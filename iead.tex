	\item People say that we can learn how to build an airplane without mimicing flying birds. But we can study on aerodynamics from other natrual phenomenons. On the contrast, intelligence is only in the animal brain. If we discard inspirations from brains, where shall we find the best model? I think the break through of AI will not come from trail and error, but from explanition and transforming. Current neural networks should not be viewed as an correct way of mimicing human brain. Instead, they are just large and complex graph models implying the power of complex connecting systems, and their accomplishment may not be done in the right way.
