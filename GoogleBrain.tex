\chapter{Google Brain}

\section{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What Google Brain can not do? Or, where does neural networks fail?
		\item What is Google Brain? What is its contribution?
		\item Can computer recognize objects from partially images? For example, human eyes for faces?
	\end{itemize}

\section{Building high-level features using large scale unsupervised learning}

\subsection{Excerpt}

\begin{itquote}
To avoid duplicates,each video contributes only one image to the dataset.
\end{itquote}
The training material is prepared as this.Is it reasonable?\\

\begin{itquote}
 It is worth noting that our network is still tiny compared
to the human visual cortex, which is 106
times larger in terms of the number of neurons and
synapses (Pakkenberg et al., 2003).
\end{itquote}
The neurons in the brain are different from 'nurons' in this model. How do they learn the parameters? How do they implement the optimal learning?
